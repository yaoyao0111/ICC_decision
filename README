The data preprocessing and parameters estimation are included in data_fitting. The next step is formulating the ICC decision
and train a deep reinforcement learning agent to learn the optimal ICC schedules.
1, Using generate_patients.py to store information of training tcga skcm patients(n=200) and testing tcga patients(n=30).
2, Using collect_off_tra.py to collect the trajectories of fixed ICC schedules and store them in buffer/Train_buffer_init_,
    which can warm start the training of DDPG agent.
3, Training the deep reinforcement learning agent by ddpg_runner.py, the trained agent will be final.pth and high.pth.
    There are three trained agents, DRL_agent.pth, referred as examples.
4, The trained DRL agent can be tested by fixed_policy_test.py, simultaneously compared with other fixed ICC schedules.
